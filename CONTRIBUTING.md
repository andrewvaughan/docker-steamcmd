# Contributing

You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates.  We are always happy to receive pull requests, and we do our best to process them as quickly as feasible.

Before starting to code, we recommend discussing plans with the core development team by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/andrewvaughan/docker-steamcmd/issues).  This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

If you are not a coder, fear not, please feel free to make recommendations, request features, report bugs, and more through the same [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/andrewvaughan/docker-steamcmd/issues) mechanism.  It is possible that a developer will pick up your idea and implement it for you!
